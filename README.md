# Java-Inverted_RightAngled_Triangle_Patterns
This Java program prints an inverted right-angled triangle using *. It initializes star to 5 and uses nested loops to control the pattern. The outer loop runs four times (i = 0 to 3), while the inner loop prints * based on star, which decreases after each iteration. The pattern starts with four * and reduces by one in each row.
